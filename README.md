Diary Web Application

This project is a web-based diary application designed for practice purposes. It allows users to create and manage diary entries, including adding titles, content, and mood ratings. While this application demonstrates how to use local storage to save and retrieve diary entries, it is important to note that using local storage for this purpose may not be practical for real-world applications due to limitations and potential security concerns.
Features

    Create Diary Entries: Users can add new entries with a title, content, and mood rating.
    View Entries: Existing entries are displayed in a grid format.
    Responsive Design: The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
    Form Handling: Includes a form for input with basic validation and styling.

Usage

    Create an Entry:
        Click on the "Create Entry" button.
        Enter a title and content for your diary entry.
        Select a mood rating.
        Click "Save day" to save the entry.

    View Entries:
        Browse through your diary entries displayed on the main page.

    Cancel Form:
        Click the close button to cancel and hide the form without saving.

Limitations

    Local Storage: This application uses local storage to save entries. While this is suitable for demonstration purposes, it may not be practical for real-world applications due to storage limits, lack of security, and lack of synchronization across devices.
